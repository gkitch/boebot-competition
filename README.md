# boebot-competition
My partner and I developed Arduino script and utilized various sensors along with an Arduino mega mounted on a BOE-bot to complete the competition challenges.

Our challenge was to line follow a pattern, detect the color of our map, and determine the height of an object placed on our map. Once we processed this data, we communicated with the other teams to calculate a final score. In particular, we used QTI sensors for line following, an RGB sensor, and a PING))) ultrasonic sensor driven by our Arduino script to read in data and control the proper outputs.
